 * A package is a collection of data consisting of entries. Each entry has a name
 * and data. Data is written with OutputStream to allow binary entries. A new entry
 * is started by calling nextEntry with the entry name. After that an OutputStream
 * that can be used to write the entry can be retrieved with getOutputStream. A new
 * getOutputStream must be used once for each entry. See notes about order of entries
 * in PackageInput.
