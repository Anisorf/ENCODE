/**
 * <p>
 * A package is a collection of data consisting of entries. Each entry has a name
 * and data. Data is read with InputStream to allow binary entries. 
 * </p><p>
 * Most implementations will probably have entries in some order (such as order
 * of data in a file). Thus it would be best if data is read in the same order
 * it is returned by gotoNextEntry. If gotoEntry method is used, the implementation
 * may need to read the file multiple times to find the required entries. However,
 * because often entries will need to be read in a specific order, care should be
 * taken when the package is created. To get best possible performance, entries
 * should be stored in the order they are needed when unpackaging. The performance
 * may suffer significantly if packages stored remotely instead of locally.
